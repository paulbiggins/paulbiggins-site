#### I'm an antenna design engineer. I'm a dabler in thing's I'm bad at. I'm an avid adventurer. ####

Hi! My name is Paul Biggins. On weekdays, I'm an antenna design engineer at Nest Labs in Palo Alto, California. I'm a recent graduate of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo with a degree in Electrical Engineering. I enjoy designing integrated antennas into unique form factors and being hands on in a fast paced environment.

I make hobbies out of things I'm not good at. In my free time I enjoy programming, fixing things I've taken apart, experimenting with microcontrollers (rPi, MSP430), and using Oxford commas. I also enjoy expanding my eclectic music tastes, fixing vintage audio equipment, and collecting vinyl.

Before I could walk, my dad took me backpacking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I've been hiking and exploring the outdoors ever since. So far I've logged hundreds of nights and countless miles in the wilderness. Biking has become a new intrest of mine as well. The frequency of my outdoor adventures has decreased as life has become busier, but I still make time for it whenever I get the itch.
